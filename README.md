# Sticky Notes App

A convenient note-taking app to help you get through the workday at the desk. 

The app utilizes localStorage to store and retrieve data in the browser, so your notes will be retained even if you accidentally  (or intentionally) closed the browser window. Just open the app once more to find your notes. There is no expiry date unless the browser cache is cleared. 

## Learning Points

- Learned about localStorage, which allows data storage in key-value pairs as strings in the browser. And since JSON is a string, it allows the storage of the data as JSON.
- Learned about randomizing colors.
